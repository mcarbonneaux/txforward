TXForward (Tranparent X-Forwarding) module
====================
What is it for ?
Enabling this module allows you to use reverse proxies (web accelerators, especially Squid) with any PHP script.
You don't need anymore X-Forwarded aware scripts: Just scripts that works only with REMOTE_ADDR.
====================
How does it works ?
It extracts the real remote address from the X-Forwarded header and substitutes it to the endpoint IP address.
The real IP (proxy's one) is still available through $_SERVER['REAL_REMOTE_ADDR']
====================
WARNINGS: 
-Enabling this module if you're not behing a reverse proxy allows people to fake their IP !
-Currently only works with 1 level proxying (no chained accelerators)

Todo: Multiple level proxying, proxy IP range checks
