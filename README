TXForward (Tranparent X-Forwarding) module
====================
What is it for ?
Enabling this module allows you to use reverse proxies (web accelerators, especially Squid) with any PHP script.
You don't need anymore X-Forwarded aware scripts: Just scripts that works only with REMOTE_ADDR.
====================
How does it works ?
It extracts the real remote address from the X-Forwarded header and substitutes it to the endpoint IP address.
The real IP (proxy's one) is still available through $_SERVER['REAL_REMOTE_ADDR']
====================
WARNING: 
-Enabling this module if you're not behing a reverse proxy allows people to fake their IP !

If you're chaining proxies, you can specify proxy depth in your php.ini.
For exemple for 3 chained proxies:

	CLIENTS <-> RPROXY1 <-> RPROXY2 <-> RPROXY3 <-> WEBSERVER
depth	   4	       3	   2	       1	   0	

You can specify:
	[txforward]
	txforward.depth = 4
This will look for the IP that is in position 4 behind the 3 chained proxies.

In case of misconfiguration,  it always falls back to a depth of 0.
